# Ensemble-HackThe6Ix
Ensemble is our web app for the Nspire Hack the 6ix Hackathon.

The idea of Ensemble is best explained in this article - https://medium.com/@tianyuanzhao/ensemble-bed243b96ec#.82082st0d

How we built it:

The back-end was done with the following tools: we used jsoup to scrape the soundcloud pages of traditional musicians such as violinists for comments.

The indico api to do sentimental analysis on the scraped comments to produce a rating as well as a text tag bubble was developed for each musician.

The front end was done in Angular.JS.
